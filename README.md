# Computer_Graphics_Project
The project "A Dynamic City Simulation with Real-time Traffic Management and Day-to-Night  Transition" is developed using the OpenGL library in the C++ programming language

The project achieved the following objectives:
1. Realistic Simulation: Create a simulation of a dynamic cityscape, including streets, 
buildings, vehicles, and environmental elements such as clouds, a bird, cars, a boat.
2. Traffic Management: Implement real-time traffic management algorithms to 
simulate the flow of vehicles on city roads, including the dynamic behavior of traffic 
signals and the influence of user interactions on traffic patterns.
3. Day-to-Night Transition: Simulate the transition from day to night including 
changes in lighting, shadow.
4. User Interaction: Provide users with interactive controls and interfaces to navigate 
the simulation, allowing them to observe and influence various aspects of the urban 
environment, such as traffic flow and also day or night transistion.
